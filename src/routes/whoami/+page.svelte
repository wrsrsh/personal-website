			I'm <strong>Waris Reshi</strong>, a guy who likes building things, solving problems, and
			pushing myself in different areas of life. I work on software, mainly in
			<strong>sales tech, and generative AI</strong>, and I’m trying to go deeper into real
			engineering rather than just abstracting things.
		</p>
		<p class="text-gray-100">
			I run <strong>Asend CRM</strong>, an AI-powered CRM. I’ve also built a few side projects like
			a
			<strong>LinkedIn outreach tool</strong> and a <strong>SaaS starter kit</strong> that people found
			useful.
		</p>
		<p class="text-gray-100">
			Outside of tech, I train a lot—gym, running, and some boxing. I’m preparing for a
			<strong>marathon</strong> while also working on getting stronger in the gym. My goal is to be well-rounded,
			both physically and mentally, without getting stuck in one identity.
		</p>
		<p class="text-gray-100">
			I live in <strong>Srinagar</strong>, wake up early, and just try to get better at what I do
			every day.
