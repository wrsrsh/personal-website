    I'm <strong>Waris Reshi</strong>, a guy who likes building things, solving problems, and pushing 
    myself in different areas of life. I work on software, mainly in 
    <strong>sales tech, and generative AI</strong>, and I’m trying to go deeper into real engineering rather 
    than just abstracting things.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    I run <strong>Asend CRM</strong>, an AI-powered CRM. I’ve also built a few side projects like a 
    <strong>LinkedIn outreach tool</strong> and a <strong>SaaS starter kit</strong> that people found useful. 
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    Outside of tech, I train a lot—gym, running, and some boxing. I’m preparing for a 
    <strong>marathon</strong> while also working on getting stronger in the gym. My goal is to be 
    well-rounded, both physically and mentally, without getting stuck in one identity.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    I live in <strong>Srinagar</strong>, wake up early, and just try to get better at what I do every day.
